# Implement A Design From Scratch

In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

You wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

This webpage has been designed by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer. You can find final screens [here](https://intranet-projects-files.s3.amazonaws.com/holbertonschool-webstack/622/Archive.zip)

Here the final result:
